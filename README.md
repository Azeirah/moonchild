## Running the demo

Start up an HTTP server in the root directory of this repository. E.g., run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, or if you're using Node, try [http-server](`https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server`). Open the root of the server in you browser (e.g. http://localhost:8080/) and open the `editor/` folder.
